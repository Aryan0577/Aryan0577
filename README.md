# Hi there, I'm Aryan Poonia!

## About Me
- My love for computers began at a very young age. From the very start, I found building stuff very cool. Even when I got an android phone, I wanted to customize it more and more. Earlier it was by installing custom ROMs, different launchers etc. For this very reason, I joined Computer Science as it was the best way to create something for mobile devices. Even though at the start of my degree, I got overwhelmed by the subjects like Data Structures, due to which I think I should have started with android dev but sadly those things cannot be changed now. So, I started android development in my sophomore  year and since then, there was not a single day I have spent without thinking about my applications and on how to improve them. Each new app I download, I see it like "Oh! this feature is great! I can implement it too in my projects!". 
- I mostly create applications using Kotlin and Firebase as the database.
- Currently, I am studying more about creating servers ie custom backends for my applications using nodeJS instead of just simply using a Backend as a Service.
- Iâ€™ve also launched my own app on the Play Store: [Hype Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.launcher.hype)
